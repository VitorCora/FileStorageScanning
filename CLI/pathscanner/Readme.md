# API/SDK Scanning

## Scan all the images on a $PATH (folder)

This scenario is focused in covering on demand malware scan for all the most common software images hosted on a path.

You will have the capability to scan files using a simple CLI invocation or one of our many SDKs.

This method does not requires you to integrate your Cloud account to Vision One.

# Using the NodeJS sdk

This scenario is focused in covering on demand malware scan by using the NodeJS SDK.

Reference:
https://github.com/trendmicro/tm-v1-fs-nodejs-sdk

Based on the following documentation I changed the SDK to run with files and Pre-signed URLs or download Links:

Reference:
https://github.com/VitorCora/tm-v1-fs-nodejs-sdk

You can fork this documentation and change it to your specific use case.

This guide will be using the example package called fScan.ts, that live in the following link:
https://github.com/VitorCora/tm-v1-fs-nodejs-sdk/blob/main/examples/cli/src/fScan.ts

This NodeJS program after compiled will run with the following command line:

npm run client -- (-f #FILEPATH or -u $URL) --pml (true or false) --smt (true or false)

Where:

-f #FILEPATH is the path to the file to be scanned

-u #URL is the URL or pre-signed URL

-pml is the predictive machine learning (recomended to always be set to "true")

-smt is the parameter for the smart feedback (recommended to always be set to "true")

  Trend Microâ„¢ Smart Feedback provides continuous communication between Trend Micro products as well as the company's 24/7 threat research centers and technologies. Each new threat identified through a single customer's routine reputation check automatically updates   all Trend Micro threat databases, blocking any subsequent customer encounters of a given threat.
  
  REference:
  https://docs.trendmicro.com/all/ent/sps/v3.2/en-us/sps_olh/Smart-Feedback.html

It is only needed -f #FILEPATH or -u $URL, in the case of both being supplied the scanner will give preference to the -f #FILEPATH

## Installing the SDK
  
  1. To install the SDK's Node.js package, run the following commands in your Node.js application folder.

  npm install file-security-sdk

  2. On the host:

  git clone https://github.com/VitorCora/tm-v1-fs-nodejs-sdk.git

  cd cli/

  export TM_AM_SERVER_ADDR={YOUR_VISION_ONE_API_KEY_REGION}
  export TM_AM_AUTH_KEY={YOUR_VISION_ONE_API_KEY}

  Where:

   
  {YOUR_VISION_ONE_API_KEY_REGION} Will be your Vision One region, if you have a US console use **us-east-1**
  {YOUR_VISION_ONE_API_KEY} Will be the API Key created previously **(eg. the copied value from v1fs-sdk-api)**
  
  If you want to set up the Logging Level, set the following variable:

  export TM_AM_LOG_LEVEL={LOG_LEVEL}

  Where:

  {LOG_LEVEL} Valid values are **OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO**, and **DEBUG**; default level is OFF

Install your dependencies:

npm install

Build the example, setting your Source to fScan.ts(Scan files or PresignedURLs or downloadable files):

SOURCE=fScan.ts npm run build # cli

Feed the files or Pre-signed URLs that will be scanned:

npm run client -- (-f #FILEPATH or -u $URL) --pml (true or false) --smt (true or false)
